### What is Github?
###### From the [Hello World][0] GitHub Guide:

>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

### How Does it Work?

Github utalizes an object called a repository for organizing a project. Each repository can conain file folders and any files needed for the project. GitHub controls collaberation and version controling through the concept of branches.

#### Branches

Upon creation of a repostitory github creates one default branch called master. Master is the branch that your finalized finished project files are held on. When developing a new feature or adding files to the project repo they are added on a new branch.

###### Lets Create a New Branch in the Sandbox Repository:
> 1. First click the dropdown menu that says "Branch: master"

> 
>    ![alt text][img2]
> 1. Press enter! This creates a new branch with the name "feature/\<your username\>".
>     ###### Note: This new branch contains any files that were in the master branch.
